					<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
					<p>
						This lab was to edit the home page to include a selfie and a list of links to all the fun labs we are going to do later!
						We also had to maintain good file structure and not make a mess of everything.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
					<p>
						I don't know why I cared about website size differences but I got kinda stuck into the "number of columns" problems with the cat links. 
						And when I finally got it (from asking chatGPT), the text for Lab12 was way down into the area of Lab13 although all the tags were identical in CSS.
						It took way to long to find a sneaky top margin in the unordered list and take that out... 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
					<p>
						It was a really fun experience just messing around and crying about the CSS not working haha. 
						My partner and I both chose a "theme" or aesthetic for our website in the last lab and we tried to stick to it! 
						We both had a general idea of what type of look we were going for and tried our best to use CSS and HTML to match that. 
						As for me, I think I am going to start consulting our AI friends a lot earlier next time instead of banging my head against the wall 
						because the flex box isn't flex-ing right. D:
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>a little about results xD</h2>
					<p>Look at some quality file organization and some quality CSS-ing B)</p>
					<div id="output">
						<img src="img/results.jpg" />
						<img src="img/task1.1.jpg" />
						<img src="img/task1.2.jpg" />
					</div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>a little about imaginary numbers B)</h2>
					<p>
						Imaginary numbers are this silly little thing that actually isn't imaginary.
						Instead, they are an ordered pair of two real numbers split into two parts: real and imaginary.
						In math, they do a lot to help us solve problems that have to be otherwise estimated, and the coolest part is that 
						those problems don't even have to have imaginary numbers as their answers!
						One way I like to think about it is that "imaginary numbers" are imaginary because they are of a higher dimension 
						where two of our "3D numbers" is one of theirs. And because we are of a lower dimension, we can only see bits and pieces, thus imagining
						what these higher dimension numbers are... that makes it sound complicated, doesn't it... oops.
