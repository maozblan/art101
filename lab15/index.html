			<h1>TEXTBOOKS BUT BETTER</h1>

				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>
					This time we are trying to reach an API endpoint using AJAX to grab data for this website.

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Didn't have many other than a general lack of time due to it going towards week 10.
					There's always so many things I want to do for this website and so little time.
					I really wanted to do the XKCD API but it simply kept tossing CORS errors to the point
					I wanted to sanity check my code over and over again. I asked Mr. Ilia for help and we
					still can't figure out why other APIs work but not the XKCD one... so I tossed up a YESNO API
					just for this assignment. The link is in the results section.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					Honestly, kinda disappointed mostly with my work ethic. If it could be any better
					I could have done so much more this week. The material isn't hard at all (Professor
					Wes teaches it well), it's just sad I don't have the time to play around with it
					before the assignments are due.
				</p>
