				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
                    I was running the causal "mkdir" and "touch" commands and copying over the last index.html file to make
                    the new lab folder again. Then I had a random idea to write a bash script to help me do just that. With a bit
                    of help from the AI friends and a bit of referencing from referencing from past classes, no more spam "mkdir" and "touch"
                    before starting a lab now B).

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
                    It's really fun just to mess around with little things every time and not have really strict guidelines.
                    I'm just having honest fun doing whatever and somehow still passing this class haha... and sometimes I don't even spend
					most of my time on the assignment. I'm just having fun goofing off... yeah.
