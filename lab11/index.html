				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>this time we revisted the name stealing code (lab 7) and made it a bit nicer to use :)</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Sometimes I feel like I go to pay attention harder so I don't spend 90% of my time on some random
					idea I just got out of nowhere... such as "isn't this a good time to implement the cat animation?"
					lo and behold it was not but I did it anyway because monkey brain can't pay attention to what I am
					supposed to be doing... oops. My apologies :(
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					It was really fun this time. I think sometimes I should toss everything I learnt before into the back
					seat and relearn JS. I taught myself JS last year in a very disorganized fashion so the way I make a lot
					of things are not optimal. Now that I'm taking an organized and formulated class, I should probably take
					the time to build up my foundations properly haha...
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about results xD</h2>
				<p>script output:</p>
				<div id="output"></div>
				<p>
					reverse sort your name: <input type="text" id="input" />
					<button class="button" id="submit">submit</button>
				</p>
				<p>
					make an anagram of your name: <input type="text" id="input-anagram" />
					<button class="button" id="submit-anagram">submit</button>
