				<h2>a little about me :)</h2>
				<p>
					HELLOOO I'm Lyssa and I am a sophomore. I major in CS:GD and like to play small little exploration and narrative games.
					I like to wear this brown bear hat that is very recognizable. You probably won't see me around campus too much because like every other CS major, I am not fond of grass. 
					But I think that is valid because the sun is very bright in the afternoon and my eyes cannot take it. I think I got too used to dark mode on VS Code... oops.

				<h2>a little about my partner :D</h2>
				<p>
					Shiyen is a 3rd year art major and she is very cool. She does very pretty arts and always has really pretty nail art. 
					She can drive a car too. That is very cool. And she likes to go to the beach.
					Eventhough she says she is boring (I can't believe she just said that D: ), she still does more fun activities than me haha. 
					Shiyen's laptop is filled with sparkly stickers that go bling bling under the classroom lights.
					She is new to HTML and she is trying very hard.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>a little about quantum mechanics B)</h2>
					<p>
						The peculiar idea of "quantum engtanglement" is enough to boggle some minds. Perhaps the idea that two quantum particles, no matter the distance,
						is forever entangled in a state where if one particle changes in some form, the other particle will reflect that. And the worst part? Any measurement of entangled 
						particles would collapse the whole system. All we might ever know, for now, is that if one particle's spin direction is left, the other must be right. 
						So given a random quantum particle, the chance of it spinning left is 50%.
