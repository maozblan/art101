			<h1>ON COMPLEXITY AND EFFICIENCY</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>We tried to play around with simple variables and datatypes in javascript and print them onto the webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to have to user pick their own number that randommly generates a car, but the button submission 
					kept clearing the whole page. According to Mr. Ilia, it was because the button was sending a request and the writeln
					was writing from that new request (which didn't include the previous items on the page). 
					I searched up ways to remove that request but I couldn't get both the request to go away and a function to operate afterwards... 
					maybe later in the course I'd be able to do that. 
					Our AI friends suggested that I should just make another div and write into that div instead.
					So I just had it autogenerate a car this time :(
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					Sometimes I just have an idea and then it gets a bit too complicated... only to research and realize it's even more complicated...
					I do need to learn a lot more skills to catch up with my ideas. But by then the little thoughts would get even MORE COMPLICATED HAHAHA. Welp.
				</p>

				<h2>a little about results xD</h2>
				<div id="output">
					<p>script output:</p>
					<div class="img">
						<img src="img/car_bot.png" id="car_bot"/>
						<img src="img/car_top.png" />
					<!-- the script is in the header is commented out -->
