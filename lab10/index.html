				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>we are making a conversation that goes on whenever you click "say something"</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to create actually readable conversations from a conversation bank. don't know why
					but I defaulted to trying to make a generator function. had a bit of trouble to get the generator
					to new again after finishing once, but our AI friends got my back B) I just had to set it to a variable
					again which I have never done in any of my other coding classes lol.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					I think I had a bit too much fun on making silly converstations off the top of my head, so the assignment took a bit
					longer than I expected. Unlike most other labs, I kind of feel myself straying away from CSS this time since I had to
					do so much of it over the weekend my brain is kind of mushy. I wanted to try my hand at some CSS animations to do the
					"typing" effect but then I got kind of lazy...
