		<h1>CAT ANIMATION CONCEPT</h1>
		<div class="minor-section">
			<h2>final product</h2>
			<p>
				hover over each cat to play the animation!
				animations are operating individually on loop and will reset when the page is refreshed.

			<canvas class="ghost-cat-anim" data-color="red"></canvas>

			<h2>concept</h2>
			<p>
				i wanted to make a gif with semi-transparent cat PNGs from last year's CMPM80K final project. but
				GIFs that i tried to make online did not keep the translucency so i used requestAnimationFrame to animate
				it in JS instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				each cat is a 12 frame animation saved into one long PNG file, and i used < canvas > to continously
				erase and redraw the a section of the PNG picture according to which frame we are on. the following is an example of
				the full PNG for the red cat:
			</p>
			<img id="anim-sample" src="../img/ghostCat_red_anim.png" />
			<p>
				since this was to be implemented onto multiple cats on mutliple pages, i stored all the individual animation data
				inside a JS object (each cat was it's own object too! see the JS code from below) and pulled from the object when animating.
				since the animation() function cannot take arguments for the requestAnimationFrame() function to work properly,
				i also had to add an animation wrapper so i could specify which cat object should be animated for the next part.
			</p>
			<p>
				last but not least i wanted each cat to be animated only when hovered over by the mouse so i just added event listeners 
				for mouseenter and mouseleave tracker to achieve the effect. since each cat was animated individually, the separate storing of
				animation information per cat was important (see previous paragraph)!
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				tl;dr: i got annoyed at the bad GIF quality for translucent PNGs and decided to code up the animation instead.

				now i just need to implemented into the final project but i don't really want to edit all the pages by hand (each lab page has 5
				cats on it... it's going to take days) so i'll find a way to do it with a bash script when i have time :> for now i got to study for my
				midterm in 1 hour :')
