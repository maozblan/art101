					In this lab, we were asked to create a button that toggles on an off a certain CSS class for these sections.
					The JS of this lab is linked and should be written using jQuery.

				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Personally, I'm quite a bit more used to the document.getElementByID() or
					document.querySelectorAll() type things. jQuery is amazing though, although it was
					somewhat hard to use simply because I was habitually writing it a different way.
					Once I get used to jQuery, I don't think I'll ever use anything else haha.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					So... I went to a hackathon in the middle of this assignment and I was coding up this website part.
					It was so fun when I pulled out the jQuery and CSS tricks I've learnt in this class and said "Yep,
					I got this." (I, in fact, very did not got this. The CSS part was fine but the javascript was a mess because of all the 
					fuctionality I had to put in lol. jQuery did save me a metric buttload of lines though!)
