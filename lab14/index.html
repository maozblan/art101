					This week we just debugged our old code and possibly other projects. And learnt to debug!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Timeeeeeee not enough timeeeeee to do all the silly things I want to do and do them well. :(
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					It was more of a working week... there were much more things to get then than to slow down
					and make sure that things are working properly. There wasn't anything to debug in the labs so I 
					worked mostly on the group project. But even that was mostly implementation. There are plenty of better
					ways to do certain things, but at this point in time it was rather "get it done, and then get
					it done well" (which isn't good) but since there was so much to do, it is mostly just hoping we
					can get a working final first and foremost...
				</p>

				<h2>a little debugging :P</h2>
				<p>
					Fading effect on small scale "loading screen" wasn't working because
					of the extraneous "transition: opacity;" in the css when I tried to do it another way.
					There was also the fading box not being in the right position covering the other box
					so I had to turn on the borders for every div, reorganize the divs, and make sure that
					the boxes were well defined in terms of location and size. And 'z-order' was the key.
					After a long time of trying to put things over eachother by force, it was just z-order.
