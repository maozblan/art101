			<h1>A LITTLE ADVENTURE</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>
					I already did the XKCD API for lab 15 oops... so here I am doing the pokemon API.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Had a lot of problems with certain lines of JS running before they were supposed to,
					and a lot of synchronization issues. I tried using $.when() and Promise.all but it didn't
					exactly work. $.when() I don't quite understand and Promise.all was not working because
					I was not returning an iteratable, I just wanted to use it to synchronize and run the script
					in the order I want it to run. I ended up having to use async/await to get it to work.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					It was a really fun one because I actually had something that was interactable for more than 20 seconds
					haha. It was a bit difficult to test because I have zero pokemon knowledge so I had to get one of my
					dormmates to test it for me. It was funny because the answer checking was shuffled for the longest time
					and I didn't catch that because I don't know what pokemon has what name.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about results xD</h2>
				<p>guess that pokemon game:</p>
				<label for="pokemon-number">number of pokemon per round : </label>
				<input name="pokemon-number" type="number" placeholder="1" min="1" max="15" step="1" id="pokemon-count" />
				<div class="score"></div>
				<br />
				<div class="button-wrapper">
					<button id="reload-button" class="button">reload pokemon</button>
					<button id="submit-button" class="button">submit guesses</button>
					<button id="reset-button" class="button">reset score</button>
