				<h2>a little about challenging things :)</h2>
				<p>We are learning how to pseudocode!! And break complicated tasks down into smaller pieces.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about my problems :0</h2>
				<p>
					Everything kept being messed up because I put the pre and the code tag wrong oops... 
					It was the first time I used the pre or code tag and I got kind of confused.
					But then I searched it up so it was all good. Thank you AI friends :D
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little self reflection :D</h2>
				<p>
					I never really thought about pseudocoding since in other classes we usually jump straight in anyway.
					It was super fun to work through the pseudocoding and trying not to write actual code haha...
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>a little about results xD</h2>
				<p>some fancy code things</p>
				<div id="output">
						<pre><code>
/* list for repotting a plant */
1. Buy a separate larger pot/container for plant you want to repot
2. With the appropriate soil for plant, create a small soil base in the new pot for the plant
3. Carefully remove the plant from its current container
4. Place more soil in the new pot and create a supportive mound in the middle
5. Place the plant in the new pot in the center
6. Fill the pot with soil and secure plant
7. Water the plant 
8. Place in a spot with the right light and temperature conditions

						</code></pre>
						<pre><code>
/* list for rock paper scissors */
1. Find a friend
2. Count “rock”, “paper”, “scissors” 
3. Do a hand motion (rock, paper, or scissors) at the same time
4. Figure out who won
	a. Rock > scissors, scissors > paper, paper > rock
						</code></pre>
						<pre><code>
/* pseudocode for rock paper scissors */
// find a friend (over the internet)
// make buttons for “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”
// have countdown 
	// (start loop) start the game :D
		// begin countdown for choosing one button
		// each player picks a button but their choice is hidden from the other player
		// button selection is locked once countdown ends
		// print “rock”, then “paper”, then “scissors” on the screen
		// print “shoot” on the screen
		// print both player’s pick onto the screen
		// check for winner and loser
			// winner = ROCK when rock and scissor, SCISSOR when scissor and paper, PAPER when paper and rock
			// loser = ROCK when rock and paper, SCISSOR when scissor and rock, PAPER when paper and scissors
			// if both players pick the same thing, loop! 
// congratulate the winner
