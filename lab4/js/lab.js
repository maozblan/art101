// find a friend (over the internet)
	// make buttons for “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”
	// have countdown 
		// (start loop) start the game :D
			// begin countdown for choosing one button
			// each player picks a button but their choice is hidden from the other player
			// button selection is locked once countdown ends
			// print “rock”, then “paper”, then “scissors” on the screen
			// print “shoot” on the screen
			// print both player’s pick onto the screen
			// check for winner and loser
			// winner = ROCK when rock and scissor, SCISSOR when scissor and paper, PAPER when paper and rock
			// loser = ROCK when rock and paper, SCISSOR when scissor and rock, PAPER when paper and scissors
			// if both players pick the same thing, loop! 
	// congratulate the winner
